# React-Project-Defence

 Project defence for Softuni by Tervel Gavrilov
Repository needs to be linked till 17 November.
Needs to be done till 8 December.
--------------------------
The project is an online marketplace, where logged users can add their
products to be sold. They are also able to freely edit or delete these 
products.
Each product has a details page, where other logged users , who are not the owners of these offers, are able to add
and delete their comments. As well as put the desired articles in their cart.
The cart section shows all products that the user desires to buy, with option to remove them if they change their mind.

Server is provided by Softuni. Rest is made by me.
--------------------------
HOW TO START:
Go to server terminal and type "node server js" for the server.
Go to client terminal and type "npm run dev" for the client application.
